                        <p>Affirmations are a tool that assists in shifting our perception from negative thoughts/feelings to positive ones. Think of affirmations as weights to tone the muscles in our brains and help maintain the mind fit. The more we use them, the more we can see good results in our lives.</p>
                        <p>Many times, our thoughts aren't pleasant.
                            We can think the worse about ourselves at work, in a relationship, about our dreams, and even ourselves. By the time we get to adulthood, it can be challenging to change our mindset to experience a balanced life and not affect our mental health. Affirmations can help ease the internal chaos. It doesn't mean that challenges will disappear, but we can develop the inner alignment and courage to face our dark days and grow from them.</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="../assets/img/thinking.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">It's time to live in the moment, don't think about the past or worry about the future.</span>
                        <p>Daily affirmations can inspire and motivate us to keep moving forward in our journey. They help us to get mentally fit, to develop muscles in the brain that produce positive energy, thus allowing our hearts to be filled with hopes.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">How to use affirmations?</h2>

                        <p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>
                        <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Final Frontier</h2>
                        <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>
                        <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>
                        <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>
                        <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>
                        
                        <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>
                        <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
