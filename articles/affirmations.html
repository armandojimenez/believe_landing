                        <p>Affirmations are a tool that assists in shifting our perception from negative thoughts/feelings to positive ones. Think of affirmations as weights to tone the muscles in our brains and help maintain the mind fit. The more we use them, the more we can see good results in our lives.</p>
                        <p>Many times, our thoughts aren't pleasant. We can think the worst about ourselves at work, in a relationship, about our creative dreams, and even ourselves. By the time we get to adulthood, it can be challenging to change our mindset to experience a balanced life and not affect our mental health. Affirmations can help ease the internal chaos. It doesn't mean that challenges will disappear, but we can develop the inner alignment and courage to face our dark days and grow from them.</p>

                        <span class="caption text-muted">Affirm: I am perfect, I am whole, I am loved; my body is loved.</span>
                        <p>Daily affirmations can inspire and motivate us to keep moving forward in our journey. They help us get mentally fit and develop muscles in the brain that produce positive energy, thus allowing our hearts to be filled with hopes.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">Affirm: "I am Divinely guided and protected at all times."</blockquote>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">How to use affirmations?</h2>

                        <p>Writing affirmations does not have to be a complex process. One of the best ways is to find a quiet and favorite space where you can focus on creating these statements that will better your life. While you make your affirmations, think about the negative thoughts that affect your daily life, and write down a positive affirmation to counteract that thought pattern. For example, if you think “I am ugly and unsuccessful,” then write an affirmation like this: “I am beautiful and successful.”</p>
                        <p>Make your affirmations short and easy to remember. Remember, short statements can be just as powerful as long ones. Start your affirmations with “I am or “I have”. With these powerful statements, you are declaring to the Universe/God who YOU ARE. Write your affirmations in the present tense, as though you’re experiencing what you affirm and desire is happening in the NOW. For example, “I see my own value” is better than “I will see my own value.”</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">Affirm: "Everything is working out for my highest good."</blockquote>

                        <p>Don’t begin your affirmations with “I need” or “I want” since this shows lack, instead write your affirmations with a sense of gratitude and knowing that you already have it and what you desire is given. While affirming, feel the words as true, feel the emotions behind the statement, and believe that your desire will manifest. When YOU ASK, it is GIVEN.</p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">Affirm: "I trust the process of life."</blockquote>
